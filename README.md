## User Story
As a user I will be able to view a responsive portfolio. The content will cover a brief overview of my projects as a developer, an about me section, and ways to get in touch. To navigate to each of these sections the user will click and be brought down to the right section. The portfolio is responsive  so the user can navigate on their preferred device. This portfolio uses HTML and CSS to function. As a user and developer I will continue to optimize this site as I learn.
